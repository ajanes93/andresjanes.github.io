# Personal CV Project

I decided as a way to update my CV and as an opportunity to learn some new tech, that I would do this project. 
It has given me the opportunity to dive into some new frontend tech and also learn and explore some existing tech 
that I have always wanted to try!

## Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are shimmed to be a generic Vue component type by default. In most cases this is fine if you don't really care about component prop types outside of templates. However, if you wish to get actual prop types in `.vue` imports (for example to get props validation when using manual `h(...)` calls), you can enable Volar's `.vue` type support plugin by running `Volar: Switch TS Plugin on/off` from VSCode command palette.
